This repository contains textures and behavior for the "some weird awards" addon. This repo also contains test of the coin system.
**This is very unbalanced, submit an issue if you think something can be more balanced and not cheaty**

Right now awards are useless because I can't code.

Please make sure you are using Minecraft bedrock edition.
