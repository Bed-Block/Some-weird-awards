repository of "some weird awards" addon for Minecraft bedrock edition.

This repository contains textures and behavior for the "some weird awards" addon. This repo also contains test of the coin system.

Right now awards are useless because I can't code.

# Note
Please make sure you are using Minecraft bedrock edition.
